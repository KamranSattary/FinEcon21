The `/src/` includes all code utilized for constructing the LSTMs and performing preprocessing, model selection and validation. In particular, the `src/utils` script contains all utility functions, from assembling financial and macroeconomic data to iterating over a predefined selected grid. All functions in `src/utils` contain docstrings which can be accessed via the standard `[function name].__doc__`. The Python Notebook `src/NowcastingGDP_LSTM.ipynb` contains the final execution used for the paper, which is also accessible in the main directory of this repository.
